# The Python scripts are in the python_scripts/ directory
# This requirements.txt is only here to satisfy build systems that expect Python dependencies

# For the Python scripts, you'll need:
# pip install selenium requests webdriver-manager beautifulsoup4 pillow flask flask-cors

# Empty requirements for now
